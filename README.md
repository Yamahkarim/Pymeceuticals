#Pymeceuticals
### Data Visualiation with Python 3 Matplotlib  
![Pharma](img/Pharma.jpg) 

##Objective 

In an effort to fight Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer, Pymeceuticals conducted clinical trials of various drugs to combat the disease in mice.  

In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. 

<b> Matplotplib is used to visualize the data in order show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) affect the size of the tumors found in mice.</b>

In order to accomplish this I have:

* Created a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
* Created a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
* Created a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
