3 Observable Trends for the Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) in Mice. The effects of 10 drugs upon tumors in mice were studied for 45 days:1.	Out of all 10 drugs, only 2 drugs seemed to actually reduce the size of the tumors. These drugs were Capomulin and Ramicane.  2.	These two drugs were also the most effective in survival rates for the mice.  Therefore, Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective drug treatments.  3.	When the mice were treated with Stelasyn, the tumor size was barely affected. This can be seen because the measurement of tumor size is very similar to that of placebo. However, the metastatic response was 3rd best, right after Capomulin and Ramicane. I think this insight should be further investigated upon by qualified biology experts
